NAME
    File::CRBackup - Backup files/directories with histories, using cp+rsync

VERSION
    version 0.03

SYNOPSIS
    In daily-backup script:

     #!/usr/bin/perl
     use File::CRBackup qw(backup);
     use Log::Any::App;
     backup(
         source    => '/path/to/mydata',
         target    => '/backup/mydata',
         histories => [-7, 4, 3],         # 7 days, 4 weeks, 3 months
     );

    Or, just use the provided script:

     % crbackup --source /path/to/mydata --target /backup/mydata

DESCRIPTION
    This module utilizes two mature, dependable Unix command-line utilities,
    cp and rsync, to create a filesystem backup system. Some characteristics
    of this backup system:

    *   Supports backup histories and history levels

        For example, you can create 7 level-1 backup histories (equals 7
        daily histories if you run backup once daily), 4 level-2 backup
        histories (equals 4 weekly histories) and 3 level-3 backup histories
        (roughly equals 3 monthly histories). The number of levels and
        history per levels are customizable.

    *   Backups (and histories) are not compressed/archived ("tar"-ed)

        They are just verbatim copies (produced by "cp -a", or "rsync -a")
        of source directory. The upside of this is ease of cherry-picking
        (taking/restoring individual files from backup). The downside is
        lack of compression and the backup not being a single archive file.

        This is because rsync needs two real directory trees when comparing.
        Perhaps when rsync supports tar virtual filesystem in the future...

    *   Hardlinks are used between backup histories to save disk space

        This way, we can maintain several backup histories without wasting
        too much space duplicating data when there are not a lot of
        differences among them.

    *   High performance

        Rsync and cp are implemented in C and have been optimized for a long
        time. rm is also used instead of Perl implementation
        File::Path::remove_path.

    *   Unix-specific

        There are ports of cp, rm, and rsync on Windows, but this module
        hasn't been tested on those platforms.

    This module uses Log::Any logging framework.

HOW IT WORKS
  First-time backup
    First, we lock target directory to prevent other backup process from
    interfering:

     mkdir -p TARGET
     flock    TARGET/.lock

    Then we copy source to temporary directory:

     cp -a    SRC            TARGET/.tmp

    If copy finishes successfully, we rename temporary directory to final
    directory 'current':

     rename   TARGET/.tmp    TARGET/current
     touch    TARGET/.current.timestamp

    If copy fails in the middle, TARGET/.tmp will still be lying around and
    the next backup process will try to rsync it (to be more efficient):

     rsync    SRC            TARGET/.tmp

    Finally, we remove lock:

     unlock   TARGET/.lock

  Subsequent backups (after TARGET/current exists)
    First, we lock target directory to prevent other backup process to
    interfere:

     flock    TARGET/.lock

    Then we copy current to temporary directory, using hardlinks when
    possible:

     cp -la   TARGET/current TARGET/.tmp

    Then we rsync source to target directory:

     rsync    SRC            TARGET/.tmp

    If rsync finishes successfully, we rename target directories:

     rename   TARGET/current TARGET/hist.<timestamp>
     rename   TARGET/.tmp    TARGET/current
     touch    TARGET/.current.timestamp

    If rsync fails in the middle, TARGET/.tmp will be lying around and the
    next backup process will just continue the rsync process.

    Finally, we remove lock:

     unlock   TARGET/.lock

  Maintenance of histories/history levels
    TARGET/hist.* are level-1 backup histories. Each backup run will produce
    a new history:

     TARGET/hist.<timestamp1>
     TARGET/hist.<timestamp2> # produced by the next backup
     TARGET/hist.<timestamp3> # and the next ...
     TARGET/hist.<timestamp4> # and so on ...
     TARGET/hist.<timestamp5>
     ...

    You can specify the number of histories (or number of days) to maintain.
    If the number of histories exceeds the limit, older histories will be
    deleted, or one will be promoted to the next level, if a higher level is
    specified.

    For example, with histories being set to [7, 4, 3], after
    TARGET/hist.<timestamp8> is created, TARGET/hist.<timestamp1> will be
    promoted to level 2:

     rename TARGET/hist.<timestamp1> TARGET/hist2.<timestamp1>

    TARGET/hist2.* directories are level-2 backup histories. After a while,
    they will also accumulate:

     TARGET/hist2.<timestamp1>
     TARGET/hist2.<timestamp8>
     TARGET/hist2.<timestamp15>
     TARGET/hist2.<timestamp22>

    When TARGET/hist2.<timestamp29> arrives, TARGET/hist2.<timestamp1> will
    be promoted to level 3: TARGET/hist3.<timestamp1>. After a while,
    level-3 backup histories too will accumulate:

     TARGET/hist3.<timestamp1>
     TARGET/hist3.<timestamp29>
     TARGET/hist3.<timestamp57>

    Finally, TARGET/hist3.<timestamp1> will be deleted after
    TARGET/hist3.<timestamp85> comes along.

FUNCTIONS
    None of the functions are exported by default.

HISTORY
    The idea for this module came out in 2006 as part of the Spanel hosting
    control panel project. We need a daily backup system for shared hosting
    accounts that supports histories and cherry-picking. Previously we had
    been using a Python-based script rdiff-backup. It was not very robust,
    the script chose to exit on many kinds of non-fatal errors instead of
    ignoring the errors and continuning backup. It was also very slow: on a
    server with hundreds of accounts with millions of files, backup process
    often took 12 hours or more. After evaluating several other solutions,
    we realized that nothing beats the raw performance of rsync/cp. Thus we
    designed a simple backup system based on them.

    First public release of this module is in Feb 2011.

FAQ
  How do I exclude some directories?
    Just use rsync's --exclude et al. Pass them to extra_rsync_opts.

  What is a good backup practice (using CRBackup)?
    Just follow the general practice. While this is not a place to discuss
    backups in general, some of the principles are:

    *   backup regularly (e.g. once daily or more often)

    *   automate the process (else you'll forget)

    *   backup to another disk partition and computer

    *   verify your backups often (what good are they if they can't be
        restored)

    *   when appropriate, encrypt your backups

  How do I restore backups?
    Backups are just verbatim copies of files/directories, so just use
    whatever filesystem tools you like.

  How to do remote backup?
    With CRBackup, rsync+ssh your resulting local backup to another host. I
    believe with Snapback2 you can directly SSH to remote hosts.

TODO
    * Allow ionice etc instead of just nice -n19

    Snapback2, which is a backup system using the same principle as outlined
    above, created in as early as 2004 (or earlier) by Mike Heins. Do check
    it out. I wish I had found it first before reinventing it in 2006 :-)
